Project partially if not entirely canceled for the moment.

If you try to get the class or id of a common dialog in Winlator while it is enumerating the file list then the window will crash. This prevents this project from being useful.
I would pivot to winatpoint, except for all request cause every window to crash.

Querying windows should be avoided in Winlator.
